## Basic Questions on Linux

1. **What is Linux?**

   Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used for servers, desktops, and embedded systems. It is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, making it a preferred choice for developers, IT professionals, and enterprises.

2. **What are the advantages of using Linux over other operating systems?**

   Linux offers numerous advantages such as:
   - Open-source and free to use.
   - Highly customizable.
   - Strong security features (better control over system permissions and user access).
   - A large community that supports development and troubleshooting.
   - Reliable performance for servers, especially under heavy loads.

3. **What is the Linux file system hierarchy?**

   Understanding the file system hierarchy (/, /home, /var, /etc, etc.) helps in navigating and managing Linux systems effectively. It's a crucial part of Linux system administration and is essential for file management, permissions, and system organization.

4. **What is a terminal in Linux, and why is it important?**

   The terminal (or shell) allows users to interact with the operating system using text-based commands. It provides a fast, efficient, and powerful way to execute tasks, from file management to system configurations, making it essential for system administrators and developers.

5. **What is the difference between sudo and su in Linux?**

   The `sudo` command is used to execute commands with superuser (root) privileges for specific tasks, while `su` switches the current user to the root account. Understanding the distinction between the two helps maintain security and proper privilege management in a Linux environment.

6. **What are package managers in Linux, and why are they used?**

   Package managers like `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, or `pacman` allow users to install, update, and remove software packages in an organized and efficient manner. They simplify the management of software dependencies and updates, making system maintenance much easier.

### Principles of Linux

- Everything is a file inside Linux (including the hardware).
- Small single-purpose programs.
- Ability to chain these small programs together for complex tasks.
- Avoids Captive User Interface.
- Configuration data is stored in text files, allowing easy editing of settings.

### Most Used Linux Distros

- **RPM-based**: RHEL, CentOS, Oracle Linux, etc.
- **Debian-based**: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, etc.

The major difference is in the packaging method of software.

## Important Directories

a) **Home Directory**  
   `/root`, `/home/username`  
   Stores personal files and user-specific configurations.

b) **User Executable Binaries**  
   `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`  
   Contains essential user commands and executable programs.

c) **System Administrator Executable Binaries**  
   `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin`, `/usr/local/sbin`  
   Houses administrative commands used mainly by the root user.

d) **Mount Points for External Devices**  
   `/media`, `/mnt`  
   Directories for mounting external storage devices like USB drives or DVDs.

e) **Configuration Files**  
   `/etc`  
   Stores system-wide configuration files and service settings.

f) **Temporary Files**  
   `/tmp`  
   Holds temporary files created by system processes and applications.

g) **Kernel and Bootloader Files**  
   `/boot`  
   Contains boot-related files like kernels, initrd images, and bootloaders.

h) **Server Data**  
   `/var/srv`  
   Stores data and content served by services like web and FTP servers.

i) **System and Kernel Information**  
   `/proc`, `/sys`  
   Provides real-time system and kernel information via virtual filesystems.

j) **Shared Libraries**  
   `/lib`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`  
   Contains shared library files required by system binaries and applications.
   

## User Information

1. **whoami**: It displays the system's username.

   ```

3.  **who**: It is used to get information about currently logged-in users on the system. If you don't provide any option or arguments, the command displays the following information for each logged-in user.
   - Login name of the user
   - User terminal
   - Date & Time of login
   - Remote host name of the user

   ```bash
   $ who
   sam  :0 2023-10-05 10:30 (:0)
   ```
   

4. **groups**: This command is used to display all the groups to which the user belongs.

   ```bash
   $ groups
   sam: sam, admin, dialout, audio, video, deepak
   ```

5. **finger**: Used to check the information of any currently logged-in users. It displays users' login time, tty (name), idle time, home directory, shell name, etc.

   ```

6. **users**: Displays usernames of all users currently logged on the system.

   ```bash
   $ users
   sam
   ```

7. **grep**: It is a powerful pattern searching tool to find information about a specific user from the system accounts file: `/etc/passwd`.

   ```bash
   $ grep -i sam /etc/passwd

   ```

## File Permissions

Linux is a multi-user operating system, so it's necessary to provide security to prevent unauthorized access to files. Authorization is divided into two levels:

### Ownership

Each file or directory has three types of owners:
- **User**: The owner of the file who created it.
- **Group**: A group of users with the same access permissions.
- **Other**: All other users on the system.

### Permissions

Each file or directory has the following permissions for the above owners:
- **Read (r)**: Allows opening and reading a file or listing its contents for a directory.
- **Write (w)**: Allows modifying the contents of a file and managing files in a directory.
- **Execute (x)**: Allows running a program in Unix/Linux.

Permissions are indicated by:
- `r` = read permission
- `w` = write permission
- `x` = execute permission
- `-` = no permission

The above authorization levels represented in a diagram format

![File Permissions](images/filepermission.png)

### Changing Access

The `chmod` command is used to change the access mode of a file. It sets permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, group, and others.

```bash
chmod [reference][operator][mode] file...
```

**Example:**
```bash
chmod ugo-rwx test.txt
```

#### Absolute Mode

Permissions are represented in a three-digit octal number:

| Permission Type       | Number | Symbol |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|
| No Permission         | 0      | ---    |
| Execute               | 1      | --x    |
| Write                 | 2      | -w-    |
| Execute + Write       | 3      | -wx    |
| Read                  | 4      | r--    |
| Read + Execute        | 5      | r-x    |
| Read + Write          | 6      | rw-    |
| Read + Write + Execute| 7      | rwx    |

**Example:**
```bash
chmod 764 test.txt
```

#### Symbolic Mode

Modify permissions of a specific owner:

- **Owners:**
  - `u`: user/owner
  - `g`: group
  - `o`: other
  - `a`: all

- **Operators:**
  - `+`: Adds permission
  - `-`: Removes permission
  - `=`: Assigns permission

### Changing Ownership and Group

Change the ownership and group of a file/directory using `chown`:

```bash
chown user filename
chown user:group filename
```

**Example:**
```bash
chown sam test.txt
chown sam:admin test.txt
```

#### Change Group-Owner Only

Use `chgrp` to change the group owner only:

```bash
chgrp group_name filename
```

**Example:**
```bash
sudo chgrp developers test.txt
```

   ssh example.server.com
   ```

2. **Connect to a remote machine using username**: Specify a user for an SSH connection.

   ```bash
   ssh john@192.168.1.100
   ssh john@example.server.com
   ```

3. **Connect to a remote machine using a custom port**: Specify a custom port for the SSH connection.

   ```bash
   ssh example.server.com -p 2222
   ```

4. **Generate SSH keys using keygen**: Create a key pair (public and private keys) for secure SSH connections.

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

5. **Copy SSH keys to servers**: Use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the public key to a server for authentication.

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id john@192.168.1.100
   ```

6. **Copy a file remotely over SSH**: Use SCP to securely copy files over the SSH protocol.

   ```bash
   scp file.txt john@192.168.1.100:/home/john/Desktop
   ```

7. **Edit SSH config file**: Customize SSH server options by editing the `sshd_config` file.

   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

8. **Run commands on a remote server**: Execute SSH commands on a remote machine from the local machine.

   ```bash
   ssh example.server.com mkdir NewDirectory
   ```

9. **Restart SSH service**: Restart the SSH service after making configuration changes.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

   *or*

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```
